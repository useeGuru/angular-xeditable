To trigger edit-in-place by external button you should define `e-form` attribute.  
Value of it is the name of variable to be created in scope that allows you to show / hide editor manually.  
To trigger edit-in-place with `e-form` and no button for a single element, add `e-clickable="true"`.  
This will allow you to have custom form names in an ng-repeat for single elements.
